# Classical City Lab Report

- Q1) Decipher “ThieF_hIT_glass_” [Hint: flag is meaningful]
  - Rearranging the letters by keeping the capital letters as the first letters of each word, we get the answer

- Q2) Is this a keyboard error “H1rc82wa_Z|if1w” ? Must be...
  - Putthing this "error" in dcode.fr/en and using a keyboard cipher, the answer is shown when qwerty parameter is used

- Q3) Can you play the transposition game “07r5h05h473n11nhrc7553!111p7!p” ? [Hint: key is numberic]
  - By rearranging the letters, the phrase "thisisthetranspositioncipher!!" can be revealed but with alphanumeric characters and symbols

- Q4) Check the spelling “Echo Alfa Sierra Yankee Papa Echo Alfa Sierra Yankee”
  - This is a full form version by applying the NATO phonetic alphabet. Shortening this reveals the answer.

- Q5) Can you cross a three-meter-high fence “c____g0lyugtt3f4000hl” ?
  - Using the fence cipher, this converts into the flag answer when putting the height as 3

- Q6) Transposition game2 “CITNALIUPHERXIOWKCOSTECRE”
  - Using spiral cipher, this can be decrypted into the answer. Else writing this manually in a spiral manner can also reveal the flag

- Q7) This is the SUPER ROT “bOnGeWiOsDnYoAxKkAcUrRqOuM” [Hint: meaningful flag]
  -  Using cipher identifier, it showed that is used Trithemius cipher for encryption. With that concept, this cipher can be used to descrypt it

- Q8) Do you find math interesting "81 65 81 124 91 127 32 126 36 66 88 17 68 24 112 118 10 77 43 116 59 50" ?
  - Using XOR with each number with the corresponding prime number will yield a result which is the answer for this question
